# USDA Plant Hardiness Zones

## Overview
A workspace for extracting usable data from the USDA-OSU plant hardiness zone production maps. These are the only component of the product [available in the public domain](http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/AboutCopyright.aspx). Derivatives must be stripped of official USDA-OSU endorsements. However, we think that vectorizing this is a worthwhile endeavor because it is otherwise only available for purchase through CLimateSource, a private vendor.

## Methods
Full methodology for the original maps is available [here](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2010JAMC2536.1).
